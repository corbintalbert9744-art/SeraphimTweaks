DESIGN CHANGE GOAL

Replace the following elements entirely:

Bar graph section

Total Users (2,103 +12%)

Active Now (627 +8%)

These sections must be REMOVED and replaced with a Seraphim-style screenshot carousel that displays 3 tweak screenshots.

NEW SECTION: TWEAK PREVIEW CAROUSEL
PURPOSE

Show real Seraphim tweak UI screenshots in a professional preview area that users can cycle through using arrow controls.

This replaces fake analytics and makes the dashboard feel more real and premium.

LAYOUT & POSITIONING

Place this new carousel EXACTLY where:

The bar graph was

The Total Users / Active Now cards were

The new carousel container must:

Match the same dark background as the rest of the dashboard

Use the same card radius, padding, and glow style

Blend seamlessly with the surrounding UI

CAROUSEL CONTENT

Use exactly 3 screenshots:

Seraphim Zero Delay Suite (main dashboard)

Seraphim FPS Boost Suite (dashboard)

Seraphim Bloom Reducer (inject screen)

Only ONE image visible at a time.

CONTROLS (REQUIRED)
Arrow Navigation

Add left and right arrow buttons:

Left arrow = previous screenshot

Only appear on hover OR be low-opacity when idle

NOT flash

NOT glow aggressively

INTERACTION RULES

Clicking arrows switches screenshots instantly

Optional: smooth fade or slide transition

STYLE RULES (CRITICAL)

The carousel container must:

Use deep black / dark gray background

BACKGROUND MATCHING

The background behind this entire section must:
