TASK:
Keep internal product detail pages.
Update ALL Buy Now buttons (on product cards AND on product detail pages)
to redirect directly to external Payhip checkout URLs.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Product cards (image/title) STILL link to internal product pages
- Buy Now buttons on product cards go DIRECTLY to Payhip
- Buy Now buttons on product detail pages go DIRECTLY to Payhip
- Do NOT use React Router for checkout
- Do NOT create Express checkout routes
- Do NOT change server.ts
- Do NOT use internal /checkout or /buy routes
- Must work on Render.com (Vite + Express static hosting)

PAYHIP CHECKOUT URLS (USE EXACTLY):

FPS Boost:
https://seraphimtweaks.com/buy?s=1&cart_links%5B%5D=oRNea&qty%5BoRNea%5D=1

Zero Delay:
https://seraphimtweaks.com/buy?s=1&cart_links%5B%5D=kjZgR&qty%5BkjZgR%5D=1

Bloom Reducer:
https://seraphimtweaks.com/buy?s=1&cart_links%5B%5D=uXWr4&qty%5BuXWr4%5D=1

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Product Data (REQUIRED):
Find where products are defined and add checkoutUrl to EVERY product.

Example:
{
  id: "fps-boost",
  name: "FPS Boost",
  slug: "fps-boost",
  checkoutUrl: "https://seraphimtweaks.com/buy?s=1&cart_links%5B%5D=oRNea&qty%5BoRNea%5D=1"
}

2. Product Card Component:

KEEP internal routing for image/title:
<Link to={`/product/${product.slug}`}>

CHANGE ONLY Buy Now button to:

<button
  onClick={(e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    window.open(product.checkoutUrl, "_blank", "noopener,noreferrer");
  }}
>
  Buy Now
</button>

OR:

<a
  href={product.checkoutUrl}
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}
>
  Buy Now
</a>

3. Product Detail Page:

REMOVE any internal checkout navigation:
- navigate("/checkout")
- navigate("/buy")
- <Link to="/checkout">

REPLACE Buy Now button with:

<button
  onClick={() => {
    window.open(product.checkoutUrl, "_blank", "noopener,noreferrer");
  }}
>
  Buy Now
</button>

OR:

<a
  href={product.checkoutUrl}
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
>
  Buy Now
</a>

DO NOT:
- Do not remove internal product routes
- Do not change server.ts
- Do not add Express checkout routes
- Do not use React Router for checkout

GOAL:
Product image/title opens internal product page.
ALL Buy Now buttons open Payhip checkout directly.
Must work on Render.com with static + Express hosting.
