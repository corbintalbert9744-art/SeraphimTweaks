DESIGN GOAL

Rebuild the performance section to match Aphrodite’s exact performance card design and layout 1:1 from the provided screenshot.

This is a visual clone, not a redesign.

Match:

Spacing

Typography

Alignment

Card sizing

Layout structure

Visual hierarchy

Only change the color theme to match our brand.

SECTION LAYOUT (CRITICAL)

The section must be structured in this exact vertical order:

Performance Cards (top)

Average FPS

Input Delay

Network Ping

Bar Graph (below performance cards)

User Stats (below bar graph)

Total Users

Active Now

Performance cards must ALWAYS be above the bar graph and user stats.

APHRODITE MATCHING (CRITICAL)

Performance cards must look visually identical to Aphrodite’s cards:

Same clean, minimal dark card style

Same rounded corner radius

Same padding and spacing

Same number sizing and placement

Same Before / After layout

Same Improvement row placement

Same overall proportions

Only difference allowed: our brand colors
